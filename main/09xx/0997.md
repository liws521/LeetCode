## analysis
- For each person, judge whether it is town judge
    - If it trusts somebody, it isn't.
    - Expect for the town judge, if anybody doesn't trust it, it isn't.
- If the count of town judge is exactly one, return it, else return -1.
- O(mn) where m is len(trust)
```go
func findJudge(n int, trust [][]int) int {
    cnt := 0
    townJudge := 0
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        trustNum := 0
        isJudge := true
        for _, v := range trust {
            // if i trust someone, it isn't town judge
            if v[0] == i {
                isJudge = false
                break
            }
            if v[1] == i {
                trustNum++
            }
        }
        if isJudge && trustNum == n - 1 {
            cnt++
            townJudge = i
        }
    }
    if cnt == 1 {
        return townJudge
    } else {
        return -1
    }
}
```
## solution
```go
func findJudge(n int, trust [][]int) int {
    inDegrees := make([]int, n+1)
    outDegrees := make([]int, n+1)
    for _, t := range trust {
        inDegrees[t[1]]++
        outDegrees[t[0]]++
    }
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        if inDegrees[i] == n-1 && outDegrees[i] == 0 {
            return i
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```
